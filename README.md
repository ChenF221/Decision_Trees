# Decision_Trees
Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.


This Python script utilizes the pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn libraries to construct and visualize a decision tree model for recommending medication based on patient attributes. Beginning with data loading, it imports a dataset from a CSV file named "p11_medicamento.csv" using pandas. Categorical values such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and medication are transformed into numerical values using LabelEncoder from scikit-learn. After preprocessing, the script prepares the data for training, with features including age, sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol, and the target variable being medication. It then trains a decision tree classifier using the Gini impurity criterion. Visualization of the decision tree is conducted using Matplotlib's plot_tree function, generating a graphical representation of the decision-making process. Subsequently, the script conducts a test by predicting the recommended medication for a specific patient scenario: a middle-aged female with low blood pressure and normal cholesterol. The prediction is made using the trained model, and the result is printed, indicating which medication is recommended based on the provided attributes. Overall, this script demonstrates the process of constructing, visualizing, and utilizing a decision tree model for medication recommendation based on patient characteristics.
